title: Constants

The following sections contain the module constants, also known as parameter types. These can only be changed as part of a runtime upgrade. On the api, these are exposed via `api.consts.<module>.<method>`. 

(NOTE: These were generated from a static/snapshot view of a recent Substrate master node. Some items may not be available in older nodes, or in any customized implementations.)

___


## authorship
 
### uncleGenerations: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.authorship.uncleGenerations`
- **summary**:    The number of blocks back we should accept uncles.  This means that we will deal with uncle-parents that are  `UncleGenerations + 1` before `now`. 

___


## babe
 
### epochDuration: `u64`
- **interface**: `api.consts.babe.epochDuration`
- **summary**:    The amount of time, in slots, that each epoch should last.  NOTE: Currently it is not possible to change the epoch duration after  the chain has started. Attempting to do so will brick block production. 
 
### expectedBlockTime: `u64`
- **interface**: `api.consts.babe.expectedBlockTime`
- **summary**:    The expected average block time at which BABE should be creating  blocks. Since BABE is probabilistic it is not trivial to figure out  what the expected average block time should be based on the slot  duration and the security parameter `c` (where `1 - c` represents  the probability of a slot being empty). 
 
### maxAuthorities: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.babe.maxAuthorities`
- **summary**:    Max number of authorities allowed 

___


## grandpa
 
### maxAuthorities: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.grandpa.maxAuthorities`
- **summary**:    Max Authorities in use 

___


## identity
 
### basicDeposit: `u128`
- **interface**: `api.consts.identity.basicDeposit`
- **summary**:    The amount held on deposit for a registered identity 
 
### fieldDeposit: `u128`
- **interface**: `api.consts.identity.fieldDeposit`
- **summary**:    The amount held on deposit per additional field for a registered identity. 
 
### maxAdditionalFields: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.identity.maxAdditionalFields`
- **summary**:    Maximum number of additional fields that may be stored in an ID. Needed to bound the I/O  required to access an identity, but can be pretty high. 
 
### maxRegistrars: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.identity.maxRegistrars`
- **summary**:    Maxmimum number of registrars allowed in the system. Needed to bound the complexity  of, e.g., updating judgements. 
 
### maxSubAccounts: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.identity.maxSubAccounts`
- **summary**:    The maximum number of sub-accounts allowed per identified account. 
 
### subAccountDeposit: `u128`
- **interface**: `api.consts.identity.subAccountDeposit`
- **summary**:    The amount held on deposit for a registered subaccount. This should account for the fact  that one storage item's value will increase by the size of an account ID, and there will  be another trie item whose value is the size of an account ID plus 32 bytes. 

___


## imOnline
 
### unsignedPriority: `u64`
- **interface**: `api.consts.imOnline.unsignedPriority`
- **summary**:    A configuration for base priority of unsigned transactions. 

   This is exposed so that it can be tuned for particular runtime, when  multiple pallets send unsigned transactions. 

___


## scheduler
 
### maximumWeight: `u64`
- **interface**: `api.consts.scheduler.maximumWeight`
- **summary**:    The maximum weight that may be scheduled per block for any dispatchables of less  priority than `schedule::HARD_DEADLINE`. 
 
### maxScheduledPerBlock: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.scheduler.maxScheduledPerBlock`
- **summary**:    The maximum number of scheduled calls in the queue for a single block.  Not strictly enforced, but used for weight estimation. 

___


## staking
 
### bondingDuration: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.bondingDuration`
- **summary**:    Number of eras that staked funds must remain bonded for. 
 
### electionLookahead: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.electionLookahead`
- **summary**:    The number of blocks before the end of the era from which election submissions are allowed. 

   Setting this to zero will disable the offchain compute and only on-chain seq-phragmen will  be used. 

   This is bounded by being within the last session. Hence, setting it to a value more than the  length of a session will be pointless. 
 
### maxIterations: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.maxIterations`
- **summary**:    Maximum number of balancing iterations to run in the offchain submission. 

   If set to 0, balance_solution will not be executed at all. 
 
### maxNominatorRewardedPerValidator: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.maxNominatorRewardedPerValidator`
- **summary**:    The maximum number of nominators rewarded for each validator. 

   For each validator only the `$MaxNominatorRewardedPerValidator` biggest stakers can claim  their reward. This used to limit the i/o cost for the nominator payout. 
 
### minSolutionScoreBump: `Perbill`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.minSolutionScoreBump`
- **summary**:    The threshold of improvement that should be provided for a new solution to be accepted. 
 
### sessionsPerEra: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.sessionsPerEra`
- **summary**:    Number of sessions per era. 
 
### slashDeferDuration: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.slashDeferDuration`
- **summary**:    Number of eras that slashes are deferred by, after computation. 

   This should be less than the bonding duration.  Set to 0 if slashes should be applied immediately, without opportunity for  intervention. 

___


## system
 
### blockHashCount: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.system.blockHashCount`
- **summary**:    Maximum number of block number to block hash mappings to keep (oldest pruned first). 
 
### blockLength: `FrameSystemLimitsBlockLength`
- **interface**: `api.consts.system.blockLength`
- **summary**:    The maximum length of a block (in bytes). 
 
### blockWeights: `FrameSystemLimitsBlockWeights`
- **interface**: `api.consts.system.blockWeights`
- **summary**:    Block & extrinsics weights: base values and limits. 
 
### dbWeight: `FrameSupportWeightsRuntimeDbWeight`
- **interface**: `api.consts.system.dbWeight`
- **summary**:    The weight of runtime database operations the runtime can invoke. 
 
### ss58Prefix: `u16`
- **interface**: `api.consts.system.ss58Prefix`
- **summary**:    The designated SS85 prefix of this chain. 

   This replaces the "ss58Format" property declared in the chain spec. Reason is  that the runtime should know about the prefix in order to make use of it as  an identifier of the chain. 
 
### version: `SpVersionRuntimeVersion`
- **interface**: `api.consts.system.version`
- **summary**:    Get the chain's current version. 

___


## timestamp
 
### minimumPeriod: `u64`
- **interface**: `api.consts.timestamp.minimumPeriod`
- **summary**:    The minimum period between blocks. Beware that this is different to the *expected*  period that the block production apparatus provides. Your chosen consensus system will  generally work with this to determine a sensible block time. e.g. For Aura, it will be  double this period on default settings. 

___


## transactionPayment
 
### transactionByteFee: `u128`
- **interface**: `api.consts.transactionPayment.transactionByteFee`
- **summary**:    The fee to be paid for making a transaction; the per-byte portion. 
 
### weightToFee: `Vec<FrameSupportWeightsWeightToFeeCoefficient>`
- **interface**: `api.consts.transactionPayment.weightToFee`
- **summary**:    The polynomial that is applied in order to derive fee from weight. 

___


## treasury
 
### burn: `Permill`
- **interface**: `api.consts.treasury.burn`
- **summary**:    Percentage of spare funds (if any) that are burnt per spend period. 
 
### maxApprovals: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.treasury.maxApprovals`
- **summary**:    The maximum number of approvals that can wait in the spending queue. 
 
### palletId: `FrameSupportPalletId`
- **interface**: `api.consts.treasury.palletId`
- **summary**:    The treasury's pallet id, used for deriving its sovereign account ID. 
 
### proposalBond: `Permill`
- **interface**: `api.consts.treasury.proposalBond`
- **summary**:    Fraction of a proposal's value that should be bonded in order to place the proposal.  An accepted proposal gets these back. A rejected proposal does not. 
 
### proposalBondMinimum: `u128`
- **interface**: `api.consts.treasury.proposalBondMinimum`
- **summary**:    Minimum amount of funds that should be placed in a deposit for making a proposal. 
 
### spendPeriod: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.treasury.spendPeriod`
- **summary**:    Period between successive spends. 

___


## utility
 
### batchedCallsLimit: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.utility.batchedCallsLimit`
- **summary**:    The limit on the number of batched calls.
