# Constant
 
### bondingDuration: `EraIndex`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.bondingDuration`
- **summary**:   Number of eras that staked funds must remain bonded for. 
 
### electionLookahead: `BlockNumber`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.electionLookahead`
- **summary**:   The number of blocks before the end of the era from which election submissions are allowed. 

  Setting this to zero will disable the offchain compute and only on-chain seq-phragmen will be used. 

  This is bounded by being within the last session. Hence, setting it to a value more than the length of a session will be pointless. 
 
### maxIterations: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.maxIterations`
- **summary**:   Maximum number of balancing iterations to run in the offchain submission. 

  If set to 0, balance_solution will not be executed at all. 
 
### maxNominatorRewardedPerValidator: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.maxNominatorRewardedPerValidator`
- **summary**:   The maximum number of nominators rewarded for each validator. 

  For each validator only the `$MaxNominatorRewardedPerValidator` biggest stakers can claim their reward. This used to limit the i/o cost for the nominator payout. 
 
### minSolutionScoreBump: `Perbill`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.minSolutionScoreBump`
- **summary**:   The threshold of improvement that should be provided for a new solution to be accepted.

### erasStakers(`EraIndex, AccountId`): `Exposure`
- **interface**: `api.query.staking.erasStakers`
- **summary**:   Exposure of validator at era. 

  This is keyed first by the era index to allow bulk deletion and then the stash account. 

  Is it removed after `HISTORY_DEPTH` eras. If stakers hasn't been set or has been removed then empty exposure is returned. 
 
### erasStakersClipped(`EraIndex, AccountId`): `Exposure`
- **interface**: `api.query.staking.erasStakersClipped`
- **summary**:   Clipped Exposure of validator at era. 

  This is similar to [`ErasStakers`] but number of nominators exposed is reduced to the `T::MaxNominatorRewardedPerValidator` biggest stakers. (Note: the field `total` and `own` of the exposure remains unchanged). This is used to limit the i/o cost for the nominator payout. 

  This is keyed fist by the era index to allow bulk deletion and then the stash account.

### invulnerables(): `Vec<AccountId>`
- **interface**: `api.query.staking.invulnerables`
- **summary**:   Any validators that may never be slashed or forcibly kicked. It's a Vec since they're easy to initialize and the performance hit is minimal (we expect no more than four invulnerables) and restricted to testnets.

### submitElectionSolution(winners: `Vec<ValidatorIndex>`, compact: `CompactAssignments`, score: `ElectionScore`, era: `EraIndex`, size: `ElectionSize`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.submitElectionSolution`
- **summary**:   Submit an election result to the chain. If the solution: 

  1. is valid. 2. has a better score than a potentially existing solution on chain. 

  then, it will be _put_ on chain. 

  A solution consists of two pieces of data: 

  1. `winners`: a flat vector of all the winners of the round. 2. `assignments`: the compact version of an assignment vector that encodes the edge    weights. 

  Both of which may be computed using _phragmen_, or any other algorithm. 

  Additionally, the submitter must provide: 

  - The `score` that they claim their solution has. 

  Both validators and nominators will be represented by indices in the solution. The indices should respect the corresponding types ([`ValidatorIndex`] and [`NominatorIndex`]). Moreover, they should be valid when used to index into [`SnapshotValidators`] and [`SnapshotNominators`]. Any invalid index will cause the solution to be rejected. These two storage items are set during the election window and may be used to determine the indices. 

  A solution is valid if: 

  0. It is submitted when [`EraElectionStatus`] is `Open`. 1. Its claimed score is equal to the score computed on-chain. 2. Presents the correct number of winners. 3. All indexes must be value according to the snapshot vectors. All edge values must    also be correct and should not overflow the granularity of the ratio type (i.e. 256    or billion). 4. For each edge, all targets are actually nominated by the voter. 5. Has correct self-votes. 

  A solutions score is consisted of 3 parameters: 

  1. `min { support.total }` for each support of a winner. This value should be maximized. 2. `sum { support.total }` for each support of a winner. This value should be minimized. 3. `sum { support.total^2 }` for each support of a winner. This value should be    minimized (to ensure less variance) 

   
 
### submitElectionSolutionUnsigned(winners: `Vec<ValidatorIndex>`, compact: `CompactAssignments`, score: `ElectionScore`, era: `EraIndex`, size: `ElectionSize`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.submitElectionSolutionUnsigned`
- **summary**:   Unsigned version of `submit_election_solution`. 

  Note that this must pass the [`ValidateUnsigned`] check which only allows transactions from the local node to be included. In other words, only the block author can include a transaction in the block. 

   
 
### unbond(value: `Compact<BalanceOf>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.unbond`
- **summary**:   Schedule a portion of the stash to be unlocked ready for transfer out after the bond period ends. If this leaves an amount actively bonded less than T::Currency::minimum_balance(), then it is increased to the full amount. 

  Once the unlock period is done, you can call `withdraw_unbonded` to actually move the funds out of management ready for transfer. 

  No more than a limited number of unlocking chunks (see `MAX_UNLOCKING_CHUNKS`) can co-exists at the same time. In that case, [`Call::withdraw_unbonded`] need to be called first to remove some of the chunks (if possible). 

  The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ by the controller, not the stash. And, it can be only called when [`EraElectionStatus`] is `Closed`. 

  Emits `Unbonded`. 

  See also [`Call::withdraw_unbonded`]. 

   
 
### validate(prefs: `ValidatorPrefs`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.validate`
- **summary**:   Declare the desire to validate for the origin controller. 

  Effects will be felt at the beginning of the next era. 

  The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ by the controller, not the stash. And, it can be only called when [`EraElectionStatus`] is `Closed`. 

   
 
### withdrawUnbonded()
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.withdrawUnbonded`
- **summary**:   Remove any unlocked chunks from the `unlocking` queue from our management. 

  This essentially frees up that balance to be used by the stash account to do whatever it wants. 

  The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ by the controller, not the stash. And, it can be only called when [`EraElectionStatus`] is `Closed`. 

  Emits `Withdrawn`. 

  See also [`Call::unbond`].
